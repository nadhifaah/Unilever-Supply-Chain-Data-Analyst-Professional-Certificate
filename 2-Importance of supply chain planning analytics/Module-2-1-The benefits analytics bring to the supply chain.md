# The Benefits Analytics Bring to the Supply Chain

## Introduction

Supply chain management is an interconnected web of processes and activities that ensure the flow of raw materials to finished products, which products reach consumers when needed. Supply chain analytics makes this process more efficient, effective, and cost effective, which has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses operate. In this reading, we'll look at the practical advantages of analytics in the supply chain, using real-world examples to demonstrate their impact.

## Benefits of Analytics in Supply Chain

### 1. Reduce costs and improve margins

Imagine you're the manager of a grocery store and you need to keep your shelves stocked with just the right amount of product. If you invest too much in low-demand items, you risk losing money on items that will not sell. If you invest too little in high-demand items, you risk disappointing your customers. But how do you know which items are in high demand and which are in low demand? 

This is where analytics come into play. By gathering historical data and using forecasting tools, you can identify patterns and trends in customer demand. This allows you to accurately predict which items are likely to be in high demand and which ones may not sell as quickly. By optimizing your inventory levels based on these insights, you can avoid overstocking items that may lead to increased holding costs and potential waste. Ultimately, this data-driven approach helps you meet customer expectations by ensuring that you always have the right products available when they need them. 

After considering your options, you decide to optimize your inventory levels using data from historical sales and apply analytics (pattern recognition, forecast, anomaly detection, etc.) to reduce excess stock, lower holding costs, and ensure that you have just the right amount of products at the right time. Applying analytics saves your company money, increases their profit margins, and increases your customer satisfaction.

### 2. Better risk management

Consider a manufacturer who relies on a network of suppliers, transportation, and distribution channels to get their products to market. But what if a sudden weather event disrupts their supply chain, leaving them without critical components? This is where analytics can help to quantify, predict, and even simulate potential risks.

Think about the following scenario: ABC Manufacturer is analyzing historical shipping data and notices a trend of delays during certain times of the year due to adverse weather conditions. With this information, they can plan for alternate modes of transportation or adjust their production schedules to avoid bottlenecks and keep their products flowing.

In this case, ABC Manufacturer is using data to better understand risks by identifying potential disruptions and vulnerabilities before they occur. This enables ABC Manufacturer to identify potential weak points in their supply chain and take proactive steps to mitigate these risks. ABC Manufacturer can also use risk analytics to assess the impact of multiple scenarios, allowing them to make the best-informed decisions that minimize the effects of a wide range of disruptions.

With a robust risk analytics system in place, ABC Manufacturer can ensure a resilient supply chain and maintain their ability to deliver products to market in the face of countless uncertainties. Maintaining a record of readily accessible contingency plans to mitigate potential risks ensures that their operations run smoothly even in the face of unexpected challenges.

### 3. Increase accuracy in planning

Let us return to our manufacturing company. They must ensure that they have enough components on hand to meet demand. They risk tying up valuable resources such as cash and warehouse space if they overestimate demand. This can result in increased costs and inefficiencies in the manufacturing process. Underestimating demand, on the other hand, can lead to stockouts, missed sales opportunities, and dissatisfied customers. As a result, finding the right balance and forecasting demand accurately are critical for the company's success and overall profitability. Instead of relying solely on historical data to identify demand highs and lows, the company now uses data on supplier performance, lead times, and market trends to fine-tune production and distribution planning. The end result? Better forecasting, fewer production delays, and happier customers.

In situations in which analyzing historical data isn't an option or wouldn't be beneficial, a manufacturer can use other forms of analytics to assess demand for various features and configurations. Understanding what customers want allows the manufacturer to tailor their production plans accordingly, avoid unnecessary production of unpopular options, and thereby save money.

### 4. Achieve a lean supply chain

Now, think about a factory that produces clothing. Inefficiencies in their production process can lead to wasted materials, longer lead times, and increased costs. But what if they could identify these inefficiencies and eliminate them? Again, analytics will help them by using data points to pinpoint bottlenecks, streamline processes, and reduce waste. This results in a leaner supply chain in which resources are optimized, and products move swiftly from production to customers.

The factory analyzes their production line data and identifies a particular machine that frequently breaks down, causing delays. By using analytics, the factory can schedule preventive maintenance for that machine, ensuring smooth operations and minimizing production interruptions.

### 5. Prepare for the future

Consider a tech company, Digital TeleCom, that designs and sells smartphones. They need to stay ahead of the curve to remain relevant in a rapidly evolving market. But how do they predict changes in customer preferences or emerging technologies? Predictive analytics are the answer. Digital TeleCom can use data to forecast market trends, enabling them to adjust their product offerings in advance. By doing so, they're prepared to meet customer demands before they even arise.

Imagine a scenario where a Digital TeleCom uses predictive analytics to identify upcoming trends based on social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. Armed with this insight, they can stock up on the latest "must-have" items, capturing sales and maintaining their reputation as a smartphone trendsetter.

### 6. Develop a competitive advantage

Picture a crowded marketplace with numerous businesses offering similar products. How does one stand out? Analytics provide a competitive advantage. Digital TeleCom differentiates itself by using data to uncover emerging opportunities in the smartphone industry. In addition to monitoring the social media platforms for up-and-coming trends, they get ahead in the market by identifying gaps in the market and launching new products ahead of competitors. This proactive approach not only attracts customers but also positions Digital TeleCom as an industry leader. 

For example, Digital TeleCom noticed a growing trend of consumers wanting smartphones with much longer battery life. Through their analytics, they discovered that while other companies were focusing on improving camera quality, there was a gap in the market for phones with exceptional battery performance. Capitalizing on this opportunity, Digital TeleCom launched a new line of smartphones with 24 hour battery life, gaining a competitive edge and attracting customers who valued longer-lasting devices. As a result, they solidified their position as industry leaders known for their innovation and attention to customer productivity needs. This achievement requires a robust and adaptable supply chain—one capable of swift adjustments and agility, aligning with the ever-evolving market demands.
